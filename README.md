python(3.10)  StartFirewall.py, this will firstly check for a update by sending a request to skrillec.pw/updatereq, **if** the website replies with 'True' you guessed it. The program will update itself.
#
You cannot start firewall.py without the token which will be stored in Modules/0qw8ieos/.....tmp( THIS IS NOT FOR ACTUAL USE, This is just for test which means it will be removed in upcoming versions. You could simply bypass this by using StartFirewall.py untill it generates a token and cancelling it, which will Generate a token in the file stored at 0qw8ieos. )

#
**Configuration**
